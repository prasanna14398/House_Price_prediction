🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📘 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other attributes. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates house prices using historical data.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Model Used: Linear Regression / Logistic Regression / Decission Tree /SVR/

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🧠 Key Steps

Data Collection: Imported dataset containing house features and prices.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between features and target variable.

Feature Engineering: Created and selected features that improve model performance.

Model Building: Trained regression models and evaluated using metrics like R², MAE, and RMSE.

Model Evaluation: Compared models and selected the best-performing one.

📊 Results

Achieved an R² score of 0.876on the test dataset.

Visualized predicted vs. actual prices for better understanding.
